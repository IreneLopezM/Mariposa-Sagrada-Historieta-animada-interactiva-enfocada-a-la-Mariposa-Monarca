## 1.  What is the cartoon about?
It's a desktop application that shows the migratory route and the natural and unnatural challenges that the Monarch Butterfly faces to reach its destination, the hibernation forests; in order to promote awareness in the conservation of this insect and its habitat.

The cartoon is divided into five sequential chapters, each one dealing with a cause of mortality for the monarch butterfly.
During each chapter the user must make different decisions in order to safeguard as many butterflies as possible.

> #### This project is developed with the following tools:
* **Renpy:** it's the game engine where the logic of the cartoon was developed, using Python for programming.
* **OpenToonz:** to create the animations of the cartoon.
* **Paint tool sai 2:** to create the background scenes for the animations.

<br>

> #### And following the Spiral methodology.
![spiral](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107958147/223311196-ccc56a6c-5733-4aa4-8eef-2b9051b708da.JPG)

For the project, three cycles were defined in the spiral: Prototype 1, Alpha Prototype and Beta Prototype.
1. **Prototype 1.** This first phase is the one from which the spiral starts, producing a “playable” and short-term version that focuses on showing the essence of the experience of what the animated cartoon will be.
2. **Alpha prototype.** The second iteration of the spiral implements all the essential gameplay features. The functionalities implemented in the source code will be finished building and polishing.
3. **Beta prototype.** The third and final iteration, this cycle will mark the finished cartoon in functionality and gameplay. This phase focuses on finding and correcting the largest number of errors as well as adding useful features for a better experience.

## 2. What did I developed?   
* I programmed the chapters and features of the cartoon using the Ren'Py engine.
* I wrote the narrative for the cartoon.
* I redraw and painted background scenes.
